      <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.5.3</version>
      <executions>
          <execution>
              <phase>package</phase>
              <goals>
                  <goal>shade</goal>
              </goals>
              <configuration>
                  <artifactSet>
